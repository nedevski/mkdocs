## Getting started

So, you want to self-host your applications?

Before starting your selfhosting journey, it's really important to answer this question:

What do YOU want to start self hosting?

Your needs/wants/budget could dramatically change your approach and cost.

Self-hosting can solve a multitude of (modern) problems and help you save a lot of money in the long run by using free alternatives to popular cloud apps. It can also be a time/money drain if you don't plan ahead. A well thought approach can help you:

- [x] Improve your privacy by hosting your own data
- [x] Reduce dependence on various cloud services - Google Drive, Netflix, Github, VPN providers
- [x] Save money on cloud subscriptions
- [x] Provide you with a developer sandbox, that's more powerful than cloud VMs for fraction of the cost
- [x] Host your own personal websites or web applications
- [x] Allow you to control your smart home with something centralized like HomeAssistant
