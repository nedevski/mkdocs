It's a free Powershell extension that allows you to manage your devices programatically.</p> <p>To install it, open Powershell as Administrator and run the following command:</p> <pre><code>Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets\n</code></pre> <p>After you have that installed, create a folder somewhere on your PC. This will hold all of our scripts and macros.</p> <p>Create a new text file and name it <code>SetAudioDevice.ps1</code>. It's important to make sure that the extension is actually <code>.ps1</code> and not <code>.txt</code>.</p> <p>I've created a simple script that accepts the names of the devices as parameters (<code>audio</code> and <code>mic</code>), enumerates all of your devices and if there is a match - sets it as the active device. You need to provide the exact device name, otherwise it won't work.</p> <p>Paste the script below and save the file.</p> <pre><code>param ($audio=$null, $mic=$null)\n\nif ($audio -eq $null -and $mic -eq $null)\n{\n    exit\n}\n\n$devices = Get-AudioDevice -List\n\n$audioNameRegex = \"^($($audio))\\s[(].*[)]$\"\n$micNameRegex = \"^($($mic))\\s[(].*[)]$\"\n\nforeach ($device in $devices)\n{\n    if ($audio -ne $null -and $device.Type -eq \"Playback\" -and $device.Name -match $audioNameRegex) \n    {\n        Set-AudioDevice -ID $device.Id\n    }\n\n    if ($mic -ne $null -and $device.Type -eq \"Recording\" -and $device.Name -match $micNameRegex) \n    {\n        Set-AudioDevice -ID $device.Id\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In order to make using this script easier, I like to rename my devices beforehand and give them short and clear names to avoid confusion. On Windows 11 you can do that by going to <code>Settings =&gt; System =&gt; Sound</code> and opening the properties of the device. Keep in mind that you have to rename the audio output and the microphone separately, so try to set a simple convention like \"Headphones\" and \"Headphones Mic\".</p> <p>Now if you open a Powershell window and navigate to your folder (run <code>cd C:\\yourfolder</code> in the terminal), you can execute that powershell script.</p> <p>For example to set the audio output device to \"Speakers Presonus\" and the microphone to the \"Webcam Mic\", run the following command:</p> <pre><code>.\\SetAudioDevices.ps1 -executionpolicy bypass -audio \"Speakers Presonus\" -mic \"Webcam Mic\"\n</code></pre> <p>You can use only one of them or both at the same time, it doesn't matter.</p> <p>Important! If you get an error, this means that you have to allow your computer to run unsigned Powershell scripts locally</p> <p>To do that open a new Powershell window as an Administrator and enter the following command:</p> <pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\n</code></pre> <p>After that try again and it should work.</p> <p>In order to run this script from anywhere on your system, use the full path of the script, for example:</p> <pre><code>C:\\Scripts\\AudioMacros\\SetAudioDevices.ps1 -audio \"Speaker name\" -mic \"Mic name\"\n</code></pre> <p>Great!
